## Setup and Requirements
### Minimum Requirements
* OS: Windows 10 32 bit or 64 bit
* CPU: 3.0 GHz
* RAM: 2 GB
* GPU: Nvidia 600 series, latest driver 
* DISK: 1 GB


The game was tested on an Nvdia GTX 1080 at 1920x1080

### Setup
#### Cloning from Git
You need Visual Studio 2019 or newer to open the project file. Make sure your debuggers target directory is set to %(TargetDir). Your build should target x86 and the main function can be found in Main.cpp.
#### Running the executable
To run the game, open the .exe in bin/Release. Make sure you meet the requirements and change the settings in assets/settings.ini accordingly. If you have not installed the latest Visual C++ Redistributable, install it before launching the game.
#### settings
* width/height - sets the window resolution
* refresh - rate should match your monitor refresh rate
* fullscreen - sets the window to fullscreen, change your resolution before activtating this
* fov - sets the field of view of the player camera

* exposure - changes the brightness of the game
* maxWhite - everything brighter than this value gets mapped to 1
* lightAdaption - how fast the light adapts to the scene
* scale - 
* bias - 
* attScale -
* distScale -
* shadowRes - how big the shadow map texture is, gets multiplied by 1024

## Camera & Controls

### Player Controls:
* WASD - move player horizontally
* Space - jump
* Mouse - rotate camera
* LMB - pickup object

### For debugging and effects you can use:
* F1 - sets window to fullscreen (can't be reversed)
* F2 - toggle frustum culling debug mode, make AABBs and frustum visible, output culled objects to console
* F3 - toggle bloom effect (also tonemapping so image may look dark)
* F4 - toggle physics debug mode
* F5 - toggle normal mapping
* F6 - switch between player camera and free camera
* F7 - freeze frustum for culling
* F8 - toggle frustum culling
* F9 - toggle SSAO

* F11 - toggle shadow debugging, renders shadow value instead of color
* ESC - exit game

### Free Camera Controls (F6):
* WASD - move forward/backword and left/right on the cameras xz plane
* 1,2 - move up/down along the cameras y axis
* LSHIT - faster camera movement
* Mouse - click with LMB and drag to rotate

## Creating a Level
The game can load a level from a fbx file, if it conforms to these contraints:

* the Maya projects is located in the assets folder
* every texture is located in assets/texture/(texture_name)/(albedo/normal/metal/rough/ao).jpg
* in Maya only directional and pointlights should be added and only on the root node
* meshes should be grouped in rigid and dynamic, depending on them being movable or not
* every mesh must have a material assigned to it
* a material is based on the PBSstingray shader, and needs to have every textures except the emissive, associated with it
* a material must have the same name as the (texture_name) folder and can only use textures in that folder
* when exporting to fbx, triangulate the mesh, and split vertex normals. Uncheck everything besides lights and keep the scale factor at 1.0. Save as binary
